  - Initial release of django-pgtrigger. [Wes Kendall, 1f737f0]

    ``django-pgtrigger`` provides primitives for configuring
    `Postgres triggers <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtrigger.html>`__
    on Django models.

    Models can be decorated with `pgtrigger.register` and supplied with
    `pgtrigger.Trigger` objects. These will automatically be installed after
    migrations. Users can use Django idioms such as ``Q`` and ``F`` objects to
    declare trigger conditions, alleviating the need to write raw SQL for a large
    amount of use cases.

    ``django-pgtrigger`` comes built with some derived triggers for expressing
    common patterns. For example, `pgtrigger.Protect` can protect operations
    on a model, such as deletions or updates (e.g. an append-only model). The
    `pgtrigger.Protect` trigger can even target protecting operations on
    specific updates of fields (e.g. don't allow updates if ``is_active`` is
    ``False`` on a model). Another derived trigger, `pgtrigger.SoftDelete`,
    can soft-delete models by setting a field to ``False`` when a deletion
    happens on the model.
